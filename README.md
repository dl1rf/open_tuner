[Please read the rough description](https://github.com/dl1rf/open_tuner/blob/main/Doc/OpenTuner_DL1RF's_0.C.pdf)

Installation Instructions:

Unzip the binary package into a new directory to prevent your original OpenTuner version.

To get your settings from a previous version to this version copy the setting files from your original version into the settings directory of this version.

If you plan to use more than one OpenTuner instance at a time please install OpenTuner into searate directories for each instance.

OpenTuner will try to save serval data at program close and so each instance need its own settings directory for storage.

Please do not close OpenTuner by closing the Terminal Window.
In this case window layout etc. will not be stored. Please close Opentuner by closing the Main window.
Only in cases Opentuner will not stop and close (this can take up to 1 Minute in seldom cases) kill Opentuner by closing the Terminal window.

If you find issues please post it to me.

Have fun.

Martin, DL1RF
